# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

{{< figure src="images/cropped-nlisn-logo-t.png" >}}

We are a peer support network for neurodivergent staff in the Library, Information and Knowledge sector in the UK and Ireland.

We aim to provide a visible online presence; a regularly updated resources list; run a buddying service, providing a named person for informal chat; organise regular in person and online themed networking events; and produce occasional research outputs.

We welcome anyone in, or aspiring to be in, the library and information knowledge sectors who are either diagnosed, waiting for diagnosis, or are suspected or self-diagnosed neurodivergent.

There is no formal membership required, just join our JISCmail list or Forum to become part of the network!
