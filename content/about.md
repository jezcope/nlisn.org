A peer support network for neurodivergent staff in the Library, Information and Knowledge sector in the UK and Ireland.

We originally received funding from Academic Libraries North Equality Diversity and Inclusion Innovation Fund to set up this network in 2023, and from 2024 onwards, we have operated independently with a team of volunteer committee members.

## Deliverables ##

1. A visible online presence including: website, forum, email discussion list, newsletter/blog, resources list.
2. A buddying service, providing a named person for informal chat.
3. Regular in person and online themed networking events.
4. Occasional research outputs, such as conference papers, or partnered research projects.

## How to join in ##

- Join the JISCmail list or Flarum forum
- Get a Buddy, or Be a Buddy
- Attend an event, online or in person

## What will we do? ##

NLISN welcomes individuals who are both diagnosed, waiting for diagnosis, or are suspected or self-diagnosed neurodivergent.

NLISN also welcomes individuals who are current, past, aspiring, student or adjacent library, information and knowledge workers. 

NLISN includes staff from academic, health, public, school, college, law, government, business libraries and information services, and strives to make our deliverables suitable for all sectors.

NLISN is based in the UK and is aimed primarily at colleagues in the UK and Ireland.

## What will we NOT do? ##

NLISN does not have expertise in creating library services suitable for neurodivergent service users.

NLISN does not have expertise in building collections with neurodiversity as a theme.

NLISN does not have any holdings or collections available to lend, beyond our outputs as seen on the website.

NLISN’s activities are not normally aimed at allies or interested third parties.

## Tone ##

- Friendly and informal
- Culturally aware as far as possible
- Do not endorse, use or engage with problematic language, individuals, or groups where aware of it
- Open to being corrected on evolving and problematic language, individuals and groups
- Focussed on our professional strengths and talents alongside our differences
- Visible and open, showcasing highly skilled and accomplished professionals who are also neurodivergent

## Language ##

- Use “neurodivergent” to mean an individual, and “neurodiverse” to mean a group.
- Avoid using “neuro-atypical” or “neuro-minority” for clarity reasons, rather than problematic ones.
- Use “neurotypical” to mean an individual who is not neurodivergent.
- Avoid using “neuro-majority” or “allistic” for clarity reasons, rather than problematic ones.
- ND and NT are acceptable acronyms for the above.
- Avoid using the term ‘Aspergers’ (problematic term).
- Avoid using the image of a puzzle piece (problematic symbol).

## Data ##

NLISN may collect your personal contact details at several points, and we understand that involvement with us is a clear disclosure and therefore very sensitive information. We will:

- Inform you what data is collected and why
- Only collect the data we need
- Only share this data with other committee members who need it
- We may share information you tell us if it is required by law e.g. with emergency services
- Data is stored on secure institutional servers of the committee member processing it
- Data is managed and ‘handed over’ when committee members change
- Data held is regularly reviewed and deleted after it is no longer being used
- You can request to have your data removed from our processes at any point you like

## Networks ##

Where appropriate, we will build supporting networks by:

- Connecting with other LIS and wider GLAM sector organisations.
- Connecting with other ND peer support networks within other professional sectors.
- Connecting with ND LIS staff or organisations in other countries, though our focus will be on the UK and Ireland.
- Welcoming professionals who might benefit from us within the wider GLAM sector, such as archives, museums and galleries staff.
